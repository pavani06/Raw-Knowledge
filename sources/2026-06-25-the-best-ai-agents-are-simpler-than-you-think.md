## Transcript

Agentic commerce will be bigger than
e-commerce. There are cases where the
Sierra agent is actually getting paid a
commission on a sale.
>> Today, I'm talking to Zack Reno Wedeen,
head of product at Sierra, the platform
powering customer experience agents for
most of the Fortune 20.
>> Coding agents are really good at file
systems, they're really good at Git,
they're really good at grep. Let's
materialize everything into those
structures so that coding agents can
just, [music] you know, cook.
>> He breaks down how Sierra builds for
voice and why the architecture looks
nothing like a standard agent harness.
>> One of the big unlocks for Sierra agents
was how to parallelize thinking,
listening, and talking. And if this
model says it's silent, you trust it. If
this model does not say it's silent, you
trust this one.
>> We get into why a Sierra conversation is
unlike a typical LLM call.
>> You know, 10 or 15 different models
might be invoked for a given
conversation turn. So, sometimes you're
classifying and you're responding at the
same time.
>> And Zack explains how and why Sierra
built an entirely separate
infrastructure layer for payments.
>> We have isolated infrastructure where
payment info doesn't go to an external
large language model because none of the
LLM providers are PCI certified in that
way.
>> Welcome to Max Agency, the podcast
[music] that goes deep into how the best
agents are being built by builders like
you.
>> [music]
>> Most people are probably familiar with
Sierra as a customer support platform.
But, from what I understand, recently
you guys are going broader than that.
Could you talk a little bit about the
types of agents that you help people
build?
>> Yeah, so this has been the vision since
the beginning. I think because many
companies have an RFP process where
they're very specific about, "Hey, we
want to solve customer service." That is
often where we start, but we think of
Sierra as the full engagement platform
across all of the moments that matter
for your customers. So, if you're an
airline, that might be browsing for a
flight, might be booking the flight,
might be choosing your seat, might be in
my case, I have a small dog, so adding a
pet in cabin, then the flight might get
rescheduled or delayed or
cancelled, etc. etc. You need to get
your bags there. There are just so many
different things across that process.
Some of them are sort of sales, some of
them are more service, some of them are
more loyalty, but they all kind of
ladder up to the relationship between a
business and its customers. And Sierra
agents are present at all of these
different parts of the customer life
cycle. So, as an example,
there are cases where the Sierra agent
is actually, because of our
outcome-based pricing model, getting
paid a commission on a sale, which I
think is quite different from how most
people would imagine service. And so, we
get really excited about those more
exotic opportunities because they also
give us an opportunity to push the
platform forward and, you know, continue
adding to what the platform can do, and
kind of turn that into a product,
package it up nicely, and bring more to
all of our existing and future
customers.
>> How similar is the platform between
these different use cases?
>> I would say that
it's very extensible, and so you can
kind of take it in different directions.
We like to say, I think it's originally
attributed to the
one of the creators of the programming
language Pearl, but we try to make the
easy things easy and the hard things
possible. So, out of the box, pretty
similar, the starting point, but you can
kind of take it in any direction that
you want. So, it's not that, oh, there's
like a separate product for, you know,
one company versus another, but the
agents that you can build on it, and
we'd like to think of these agents as
products onto themselves, can be
arbitrarily customized.
>> What does it look like to build on the
Sierra platform?
>> So, we have a It's basically a web app.
There's three main sections. There's
analyze, build, and then there's
release.
Within the analyze section, you have
things like our explorer agent, which is
kind of the long-running ChatGPT deep
research for all of your customer
conversations and data. You have
reports, you have monitors, which are
kind of always-on evaluators of
conversation data as well.
And then within build, you have
ghostwriter, which is the agent similar
to Codex or Claude code for building
agents.
You also have journeys, kind of the
underlying source code layer, although
it's not really code. It's more like
natural language or standard operating
procedures. As well as kind of different
variables
and everything like that. On the release
side, you have all of the collaboration
and change management and governance
procedures. And so Sierra, I think at
this point we're working with most of
the Fortune 20, something like 40 or 50%
of the Fortune 50 or Fortune 100. So
very much
with a lot of the largest companies in
the world. And they have needs around
governance and release processes and
change management that have just pushed
us to develop from the very beginning,
you know, very buttoned-up procedures
and collaboration and review and all of
this stuff. That's basically what it's
like, I think, on the surface, but
probably similar to a lot of other, you
know, places that you go to build
things, whether that's
Figma or Claude code or these different
places, but just very much optimized
around no-code agent building and um
giving you all those capabilities.
>> And are those different steps intended
to be done in that order? Like analyze,
build, release. Can you analyze
basically human transcripts before you
build the AI agent? Or does analyze
really come after you build and release
the first version of the agent and now
you're iterating on it?
>> It's both. So, typically, you'll come in
with some sort of resource of how you
want the agent to be structured and
architected, how you want it to behave.
Maybe that's transcripts, maybe that's
standard operating procedure, maybe
that's a conversation that you have with
Ghostwriter.
And that will typically be how you build
the agent. So, I'd say most people will
start with build, but then once your
agent is live and production
conversations are happening, your daily
routine probably starts more with
analysis. You're probably thinking, how
can I optimize the metric that I care
about, whether that's customer
satisfaction or resolution rate or in
the case of the customer I mentioned,
like sales converted.
And so, you get those insights and then
you want to make improvements to the
agent, whether it's, you know, fixing an
issue or finding a new opportunity to
hill climb on a metric or please
customers in one one more way.
And so, that typically involves, you
know, working with Ghostwriter. Often,
Ghostwriter will actually proactively
suggest an improvement on the insights
to kind of close that loop and build
that flywheel.
Um, but I would say the day to day is
more analyze, build, release.
>> Who is doing that analyzing and that
iterative improvement? Is this is this
engineers? Is this product folks?
>> It's primarily people that have the most
depth and insight about the ideal
customer experience, which tends to be
operations uh people, so customer
experience managers,
um folks in that department at our
customer companies.
It's also a number of engineering teams
will build either other agents that
interface with Sierra agent or they can
extend the platform
uh via basically tools and packages that
you can then kind of see and introspect
on Sierra. So, it's very much kind of
the same way that you have the person
that knows everything about your
knowledge base, we want them to be able
to come in and self-serve on day one and
just, you know, make the perfect
instantiation of knowledge. The person
who knows everything about the standard
operating procedures should be able to
just do that in the product. And so
we're constantly kind of trying to sand
down all of the barriers between the
people with the most context and their
ability to contribute directly to the
platform.
>> You've said no code a few times. So,
what does this agent building experience
look like? Is it truly no code? And And
I'm assuming it's maybe something like
quad code where you talk to it and it
generates something under the hood. Is
it generating code? Is it generating a
custom DSL?
>> Yeah, good question. So, the layers of
the stack, you have kind of what we call
Agent OS, which has our constellation of
models. So, translating the tasks that
need to be done on the platform
into prompts, uh into data injection
across, you know, 10 or 15 different
models that might be invoked for a given
conversation turn. Some of those might
be frontier models that need to do, you
know, top-tier reasoning. Some of them
might be in-house models that are very
good at a specific task, and some of
them might be just, you know, classifier
models that run really well on a
uh a model that's a little bit cheaper
and more performant. And so, that's kind
of the base layer. On top of that, you
have the Agent SDK, which is the
code-based layer of agent orchestration
and context management.
That's kind of where Sierra started, but
over the last 18 months, most of the
agent development, um pretty much all of
the agent development has shifted to our
no code layer that we call journeys.
It compiles down to Agent SDK code
deterministically
and uh isomorphically, which is a fancy
word for you can turn it one way and
then turn it back and it's the same. And
so, you can have uh code that you
transition over to no code, you can have
no code that you transition over to
code, but the language of specifying it
is very much
declarative. Here's how I want the agent
behavior to be Uh when customers ask
about this. We want to unlock these
conditions and kind of flow in this
direction and we find that that's pretty
intuitive cuz it maps the type of
document that we would write for someone
joining the team in a customer
experience role or sales role. You would
explain to them how to do the job and
that's kind of what you're doing here as
well. But there is some DSL for
journeys. It's not pure raw kind of like
text.
>> Correct.
And it's very hard. I'm not sure we
could get into a discussion about it. If
you're just doing text, you have to
choose between
this is non-deterministically compiled,
which all of the experiments we've done
in that direction,
you end up I think with more harm than
good.
Or this is a prompt engineering task,
which then puts you in the realm of
engineering teams. And we, you know, are
very proud to be more in the realm of
operations teams where a lot of that
domain specific knowledge resides. The
other big piece of it is that
Ghostwriter has totally changed the
learning curve for building agents. So
you come in and you just say, "Hey, you
know, I want to orchestrate order
returns or I want to do flight booking
or I want to do car rental or
referral from primary care provider to a
specialist." And Ghostwriter just kind
of already knows those concepts and is
an expert in journeys. But Ghostwriter
is using the journeys product. So it's
not writing code, it's writing journeys
directly so that you can go inspect that
after the fact as well.
>> I imagine there's some there's some
format that these journeys have to have
to adhere to and I imagine that's not in
the models training data at all. Was it
hard to teach it that format or was it
pretty easy?
>> That's a really good question because at
every point there's this conflict
between here are the perfect
abstractions for me
and here are the abstractions that the
models are most familiar with. And
similar to in math how you're often
taking one problem and reframing it in
another problem to do a proof or
something like that. You have to decide
if you want to reframe this problem into
something the models understand or build
a skill and inject context in the right
way so that the models can understand
your way of thinking.
The truth is that we do both. So there
are cases where we'll say you know,
coding agents are really good at file
systems. They're really good at get.
They're really good at grep. Let's
materialize everything into those
structures so that coding agents can
just you know, cook. Then there are
other cases where it's like, "No, no,
no. Our way of thinking about this is
the correct way of thinking about this
and there's not really a way to shoehorn
it into what it models are already good
at. So let's do the investment to make
the models good at this. My personal
perspective is that 80% of the time you
want to do the first thing
and just meet the models of where they
are on their turf and you should reserve
the second one for that really special
case. I'm curious uh if that's what been
your experience as well.
>> I think recently it's probably gotten to
be we see a lot of people using the file
system as an abstraction and so I think
recently there's been a lot of talk
especially as the labs talk about how
they're RL-ing the models to be really
good for their hardness to try to fit
everything into a file system or this
particular like edit file tool or things
like that. I also think that the models
are really good at writing certain
packages. Like if you're in the training
data, I think I think a lot of LangGraph
is in the training data. So I think at
least Anthropic models recommend
LangGraph for a lot of use cases and
that's great.
But for newer things like deep agents,
which is a new package we have, it's not
in the training data at all. We spend a
little bit of time, not maybe not as
much as we should, but we spend a little
bit of time thinking about what makes
these models good at writing certain
things. We really have no clue how to
like affect know how to affect what goes
in the training data, but it's a really
interesting thing and so I think there's
definitely been cases where we see that
people choose technology because the
models are really good at writing it.
And so one question I was also going to
ask for the agent SDK, I imagine that's
you know, your own custom kind of like
framework built in house. I don't know
if you experimented with having It
sounds like you didn't you you're not
having Ghostwriter write that directly,
but like that's obviously much more
closer to code and so I was curious if
you experimented with Ghostwriter or any
model like writing agent SDK versus just
writing like raw code. So, yes, um
one of the things too is if you almost
do the abstraction that the models are
really good at, it can be overconfident
or it can be familiar and successful.
And so you have to be very thoughtful
about going either all the way there or
just not going there at all.
>> Like you're saying agent SDK is
somewhere in the middle and that might
actually confuse it.
>> Exactly. Exactly. Um
we have kind of reinvented the agent SDK
two or three times as models improve. So
it used to be you had to have more
deterministic guardrails in order to get
the behavior that you want. Now there's
more room for reasoning at each
individual step and you can kind of push
out the frontier of that reliability
versus reasoning trade-off. So that's
been very interesting. The reason for
Ghostwriter primarily or entirely
editing no code is just that that's
where the vast majority of activity is
on the platform today. So that's what
our customers know and so making
Ghostwriter good at it is really where
all of the payoff is.
I think if we tried to do it for code,
it would be a a similarly scoped task,
but it would be hard to get it to be
really good at both at the same time.
There's always going to be some
trade-off.
>> Do you still let users edit the agent
SDK code if they want or is that now
like completely abstracted away from
them in terms of just pitch journeys?
>> So the core agent SDK is part of the
Sierra platform,
but building agents in code is totally
something you can do. One example is a
number of our customers have CI/CD a
continuous integration pipelines that
they want to make sure their agent is
released on. And so they need to get
repository, which is where their agent
lives. Another example is sometimes you
have a particularly complex tool that
has interacts with a streaming API or
something in a way that is just easier
to model in code than in no code. And
so, the way that these work is because
no code compiles down to code, you can
kind of import or under the hood it will
import code files and compiled no code
files kind of all as though they're the
same thing because they are.
So, I think this is a benefit of
starting out as a code-based platform is
that we still support it. We have a
number of customers that have dozens or
in a few cases 100-plus developers
building on the platform. And
sometimes for that, you know, they work
in Git, they release in Git. And so,
being part of their enterprise change
management protocol just means
supporting Git.
>> You mentioned that the agent SDK has
changed over over the past few years as
everything in the space has. Um,
what does it look like now and how has
it changed? What does that evolution
look like?
>> So, it started out we call this now
flow-based, very much like, you know, do
this. And it wasn't just like do these
things. I think I'm a big fan of your
not another workflow builder blog post.
So, it wasn't that rigid, but it would
be hey, you know, make sure you collect
their email before you say that you're
going to send them a confirmation email,
right? Very clear to us, but you would
want to do those things in that order.
Now, I think if you think about just the
way that agents can reason through tool
calling,
instead of having to specify that in the
actual structure of your agent, you
might just give it the context that in
order to call this tool, you know, as a
prerequisite you should have their
email.
And it will know how to ask for it. So,
it's really like you'll just say that in
the prompt. Yes.
Or, you know, eventually all things end
up in prompts, but it would be in the
journey.
And so, as you're kind of writing it
out, you would specify that that's one
of the rules or policies of the journey.
And then the agent can take care of the
rest. I think it's a mix of the models
getting better and our orchestration
platform becoming even more
sophisticated and robust. So, when I
talk about that constellation of models,
there's a lot of We talked a little bit
before about Linnaeus and Darwin.
There's post-training that goes into
that. There's model selection and eval
and prompt engineering as well. And so,
I think it's it's kind of equal parts
model improvements and platform
improvements.
>> I want to talk about this model in a
second, but I want to stay on the
harness for a little bit. How similar
does it look like in its current form to
a coding agent harness? Does it have
access to skills and sub-agents in the
same way that someone using Claude code
would would have?
>> So, the one
constraint we have that Claude code
doesn't have is latency. Majority of
Sierra conversations are voice. And if
you're not responding in 1 or 2 seconds,
then people wonder where you went. And
so,
we are highly optimized for these low
latency use cases. There's a ton of
parallelism.
That being said, at a high level, it is
using a lot of the same models. It has
access to tools. Um so, there's a lot of
similarities. There are also, you know,
you can invoke other agents from the
Sierra agent. So, the core What's best
for the core conversation loop isn't
typically what's best for software
development. But you might want to say,
"Hey, let me actually give you a
callback in 20 minutes after I figure
this out." And then you would have a
type of loop that runs, you know, more
like Claude code.
>> And for those for those longer loops
that might happen in the background, are
those also built on the Sierra platform
and are just a separate type of agent
that remove the latency constraint?
>> You can do it either way. So, you could
have a Sierra agent calling out to
another Sierra agent or you could also
have a Sierra agent calling out to an
in-house platform. And because so many
of our customers have their own
technology teams and a robust array of
different AI projects internally.
They might be experts in a particular
area. Like they might have document
generation handled themselves and that
might be a long-running agent and then
the Sierra agent can call out to it and
wait for a response. So it's kind of up
to you to choose and we find that
enterprises are varied enough that they
appreciate kind of having choice.
>> When you do these agent-to-agent
communications, are you are you using
A2A or one of the protocols specifically
for that or MCP or just an in-house, I
don't know, REST API call?
>> The most common is an API call. When you
know who you're talking to in advance,
often times you can save a lot of tokens
and make sure that you're 100% accurate
that way. That being said, Sierra agents
support the MCP and agent-to-agent
protocols. You can kind of install that
integration and then your agent can be
an MCP client. You can also set up your
agent to be an MCP server. So this is
how we support ChatGPT apps
uh which rely on MCP servers. Basically,
the tools of the agent can be made
available to ChatGPT and then you can
at-reference a Sierra agent. The example
uh that would be most familiar is
Redfin.
Um if you do if you go to redfin.com and
do their AI search, uh under the hood,
it is a Sierra agent that is returning
the home listings and having the
conversation with you and that agent is
also, I believe, available in ChatGPT.
>> Interesting. I I didn't realize that
Sierra agents could be ChatGPT apps. Is
that the right terminology for them?
>> It is. Yeah, exactly.
>> Do you have Do you have an opinion or
hot take on in the future, do you think
people will be interacting with the
agents that represent brands on
dedicated chatbot websites or in uh
ChatGPT or central chat engine?
>> I think that agentic commerce will be
bigger than e-commerce.
So, if I think about how I get things
done today, it used to be that I went to
websites and clicked around. Now, I ask
Codex or Claude to do things for me.
And I don't see why I won't do that to
manage my subscriptions, to order
supplies to my home, to make dinner
reservations. It just feels like that's
where we're headed.
And so, if that's happening, I think
brands will want to be ready on the
other side of that. So, we're very much
planning for that world. We were
investing in payments before it made
sense, I think, and it's a long process,
but a few months ago, we announced, you
know, we're uh fully PCI DSS level one
certified.
>> no clue what that means. What does that
mean?
>> payment card industry.
>> Okay.
>> Um oh, man, you stump me on DSS. Uh
[laughter]
I have uh some of the other acronyms um
in my head, but um
>> We'll We'll put it in in post.
>> Okay. Okay, thanks. Oh, man, it must be
like digital
I don't know. I know that the We were uh
certified by a QSA, which is a qualified
security assessor. And uh what that
means is we're able to do the only voice
payments platform, certainly at launch,
I think still this is the case, where
you don't need to transfer to another
platform. So, it's a co- cohesive
experience throughout checkout. And all
the work that went into that, we have
isolated infrastructure where the
payment info doesn't go to a large
language model, doesn't go to an
external large language model, because
we have none of the LLM providers are uh
PCI certified in that way.
And so, putting that all together is
like spinning up a separate cluster, you
know, getting certified, um making sure
all of our operational rituals, you
know, conform to what the security
assessor is looking for.
And we put in that work because we
believe in this future where agentic
commerce is actually bigger than
e-commerce. And I think e-commerce is in
the hundreds of billions of dollars at
this point, couple percentage points of
GDP or something like that just in the
US. And so if you think about that
space, um it's pretty big.
>> And by agentic commerce, do you mean
like chat GPT talking to uh Sierra agent
that represents Redfin, or do you mean
someone going to Redfin's agent no
matter where it is and talking with it
there?
>> Both, both. I do think that the majority
of this will be from personal agents.
Just looking at user behavior, we spend
so much time in Claude and chat GPT and
Codex
that you have to think that's where a
lot of that behavior will accrue.
>> And do you think those agents will
interact with another agent? Why not
just the raw APIs themselves?
>> I do. I think that as you think about
being ready for that world,
um the same way that you might want to
use Shopify or you might want to use
certain software on your website to do
product recommendations, to do checkout,
uh you might want to use Stripe.
Similarly, you'll want to use a platform
that can make sure that you're
presenting your products in the right
way, that you're making checkout as easy
as possible, and that you're showing up
at your best, whether it's for a
customer that's browsing or for an agent
that's browsing. The one thing that I
think is pretty different is the
attention
isn't necessarily valuable in the same
way.
Like our eyeballs are more valuable than
an agent just, you know, spewing out
tokens assuming that no one's ever going
to look at it. At least I think that's
true for now. At some point it lands up
in some future training run and maybe
has value, but I think that's de minimis
relative to getting us to look at
things. And so I do feel like maybe
that's a bit different, but the
presenting yourself in the right way,
making it easy to check out, making it
easy to understand what products are
available, to express the preferences of
whoever is responsible for that agent
going off and doing something
commercial. That all still feels
relevant to me. I've seen some dev tools
provider, I think Sentry, doing a
similar thing where they have a bunch of
APIs, obviously, for the underlying
platform, but they also have an endpoint
to just ask questions of the agent
directly. And I think you could make a
counterargument that like, great, brands
should absolutely care about how the
platform's being used and how it's being
presented, but you could do that with
skills or or some other mechanism to
expose that to the agent. And I I
honestly don't know which one's right,
but it it has been interesting to see
the whole space is so new, but
increasingly so companies exposing
agents as endpoints to interact with
rather than the endpoints themselves.
>> I agree. I think that all of this stuff
you could try to do it yourself. It
might be that certain companies, that's
the best option.
What we've seen is that because there's
often tens or hundreds of millions of
dollars on the line, in some cases
billions of dollars on the line, you
really want to make sure you're getting
the best solution. And so if you're
going to be 90% as good at it as you
could be partnering with a company like
Sierra,
it still makes sense to partner and, you
know, get that extra few billion
dollars.
>> One last question on this fun side
tangent, payments. How early are we?
>> I think we're really early.
I personally still don't order paper
towels with Codex. I don't know if you
do.
>> No, and that's why I asked. I'm glad
that you said that cuz I know I'm not
close to doing that. And so I was
wondering how far behind I was.
>> I mean, yeah, like
I also didn't do it with Alexa. You
know, I think for some of that really
easy stuff, you could probably have done
it already.
The one that I think will definitely
become a thing is there are a lot of
apps that claim they can, you know, go
through all of your subscriptions and
cancel the ones that you're not using.
That feels like as a consumer, that's a
useful service. I'm definitely closer to
doing that with Codex than I am
with an app. You know, it would it would
be so much work to tell it all the
things and try to tell it which ones to
cancel. It's a very manual process.
If I gave Codex or Cloud Co-worker or
something just access to my browser and
said,
"Hey, you know, go to all of the
streaming apps and like the ones that
I'm not logging into,
just, you know, cancel those and let me
know if you need my password." And
obviously you have to figure out how to
make that secure and everything. But I
feel like that I would have demand for
that product.
>> Going back to the harness for a little
bit, you said something earlier about
things running in parallel. Is that like
guardrails that you're running or
retrieval steps or what's running in
parallel in in this process?
>> So many things. One example, knowledge.
We will
often look up answers before we know if
we want them.
So you'll, you know, before you decide
whether this question needs an answer,
you'll at least have the answer ready or
in parallel with deciding. So sometimes
you're classifying and you're responding
at the same time. Basically speculative
execution.
Another example would be transcription,
what we call ensembling.
Um I think we might have published a
blog post on this today, which is great.
Go read it. We've learned so many things
from being a
uh modular architecture on voice. This
was an early decision we made that I
think has totally played out to our
advantage where we have the ability for
any language, for any customer, for any
use case to multi-home providers
uh across transcription, across
synthesis, and across native uh
voice-to-voice models. And so on the
transcription side, for example, it just
turns out uh when you have a thick UK
accent from northern UK or at least
parts of northern UK. I don't know
exactly the region.
There is one model that has the highest
quality transcription,
but it hallucinates during silence more
than other models.
So, we run two models in parallel.
And if this model says it's silent, you
trust it. If this model does not say
it's silent, you trust this one. And so,
that's just an example where we're
running those in parallel. Uh we have
logic for when you take the right one,
and it's very specific. And if you had,
you know, all your chips in with one
provider or one system, uh or you
weren't doing things in parallel, you
would inevitably hit the limits of what
that provider can do. So, the same way
we use Claude and Gemini and the
GPT-class models, we're also able to use
all of the leading players on the
transcription and synthesis and
speech-to-speech side as well.
>> You mentioned you have some in-house
models as well. What do those models do,
and why did you guys decide to build
those in-house?
>> So, uh knowledge is a great example. I
think whenever we are pushing the limits
of what's possible, we always consider
whether we should build this in-house
whenever it's limiting our ability to
deliver more for our customers.
So, an example where we're probably not
the company is these, you know, many
millions of dollar training runs that
produce the GPT-5.5 class models. And,
you know, Mythos, I'm sure is a many,
many millions or tens or hundreds of
millions of dollars training run um to
get that produced. And that's stuff that
OpenAI and Anthropic are just the best
in the world at.
I think what we're the best in the world
at is going really deep with customers,
understanding all of the process
knowledge uh specific to their industry,
specific to their company, specific to
their customer base.
And then having the products that can
allow them to serve those customers as
best as possible. And so, an example
like knowledge where we were hitting the
limits of the retrieval and reranking
that we could do with out-of-the-box
models, we asked the question of, you
know, should we create our own models
here
um and eval them. And we have a research
team that's pretty sizable and tightly
integrated with our product teams. And
so, we can flex that muscle when we need
to, but we try not to be doing it just
for the sake of doing it.
>> You mentioned something like every run
of the agent would have 10 to 15
different model calls. If you had to
guestimate like how many of those are
frontier model calls versus like
in-house fine-tune versus not frontier
model but but third party?
>> So, for a typical, um, turn of a
conversation, I would guess that and
this is just ballpark, but, you know,
being, uh, precise rather than being
accurate. Uh, I think maybe a couple
frontier model, a handful of classifiers
that probably don't require that, a
handful of speculative execution in the
case of voice in particular to make sure
that it's low latency. Um, sometimes
there will be an interim response that's
generated to, you know, the same way
you'd say, "Hold on a minute, I'm just
pulling up your account." Like that kind
of thing. Roughly like a third a third a
third or a quarter quarter quarter, but
I would say the frontier models just
because they might be slower or more
expensive would probably be, you know,
more doing the bulk of the reasoning but
in one or two inferences for a given
conversation turn.
>> Do you ever end up training models
specific to a customer?
>> It's not something that would be out of
the question, but I can't think of a
specific example. The reason I pause is
because we do have our agent data
platform
and there are machine learning models
that power strategies that are specific
to customers. But in terms of like a,
uh,
you know, language model or generative
model, we don't have cases of that.
>> What's the agent data platform and what
does it power?
>> Basically, one thing we realized pretty
early on is large language models are
really good at in the moment empathy.
Oftentimes better than we are of
understanding, okay, you You I
understand you're having a hard time.
I'm really sorry about that. And it's
the same way when you walk into
a restaurant that has amazing service or
a hotel that has amazing service, they
recognize the moment you walk in, okay,
this person just got off a really long
flight or this person's 10 minutes late
to their reservation and they were stuck
in traffic and I'm just going to let
them know that that is not a problem.
Their table is ready.
And large language models have that,
especially on a platform like Sierra.
But they don't necessarily know what you
care about at a level deeper than that.
And oftentimes the previous generation
of AI or recommender systems have a
better understanding of some of those
things.
And so what Agent Data Platform does is
it can either integrate with your
customer data platform, all your
internal systems, or you know, you can
have it just on Sierra or you can do
sort of a zero copy integration.
And it can take that structured data
that knows what to recommend along with
the here and now and now in the use
those to
generate uh better conversations, better
uh orchestrations around how you want
customers to feel and what you want to
do for them.
Um so that all sounds maybe a little bit
abstract. Uh one example would be during
sales. Oftentimes there's structured
data that knows the right offer to
present, but doing it just with that
structured data with the previous
generation of AI and before Sierra feels
very stilted or it feels like you know,
I don't know why you're doing this. And
so large language models can really
understand how to present an offer,
uh how to attribute it, weigh two
different offers based on conversation
context and pick the right one for the
moment and that kind of thing. So we see
it a lot with sales, with loyalty and
retention, those types of conversations.
>> One of the last agents we haven't talked
about too much is Explorer.
>> Yes.
>> What is Explorer? What does it look like
under the hood?
>> I've described it as chat GPT deep
research uh for all of your customer
context and conversations and all of the
data on Sierra. And so what it allows
you to do
is basically instead of having to go
spelunking for the specific insight in
reports or in monitors, you can just ask
the question. You can say, "Hey,
I noticed my resolution rate dipped, you
know, why was that?" Or "How can I
generate more sales?" Or
"I wish that more people were converting
from trial to, you know, full-time paid
plan. How come that's not happening?"
And then more than that, you can set up
automations so that, you know, on a
daily basis, for example, Explorer can
ask the same questions proactively.
And then partner with Ghostwriter. We
currently think of these as kind of two
separate agents, the analysis agent and
the authoring agent,
to say, "Oh, here are some fixes that
are suggested to improve." And you can
chat with Ghostwriter and kind of pick
it up from there. Under the hood where
this is converging, I think is a shared
harness that is an expert at using Agent
Studio,
Sierra's platform. Um and so that's kind
of what we've been setting up in terms
of what we talked about at the
beginning, like,
you know, figuring out the file system
architecture that maps to the product.
Um and so as we've exposed more and more
tools,
um you know, like building knowledge
bases to these agents, they get more and
more powerful and we see a lot of
emergent behavior between both.
>> Does this harness end up looking more
similar to like a coding agent harness
than the the harness that's part of
Agent OS or Agent SDK?
>> Yes. Um so this is less of a quick-turn
conversational agent and more of a
longer-term deep analysis agent. And so
it ends up looking a lot more like a
cloud coder or Codex.
>> One of the things I've been thinking
about, I'm curious if you have a take
here.
In a year, two years, three years, will
there be the split just in terms of
harness? Ones that's optimized for kind
of like, yeah, lower latency, external
facing, customer experience type things.
Voice is maybe heavily involved. And
another that's really focused on these
deep research, maybe coding, like you're
running in a sandbox, things like that.
Or will just end up converging into one
harness that, you know, depending on how
you prompt it or, you know, has these
async sub-agents in the background that
can maybe run for longer periods of
time.
>> I think there will always be latency,
performance, cost tradeoffs and
different architectures that emerge
because of that.
I've actually been surprised by how many
different types of model companies there
still are.
And when I talk to people who are
particularly AGI filled about it and I
say, "Hey, what's like a cool model
opportunity that's not flying like so
close to the sun that the labs will do
it?" They'll say, "Oh, well, you'll just
ask, you know, GPT-12 to make that
model, so it's actually not a big
opportunity." But I think in reality, at
least up until now, I'll probably look
dumb when AGI comes out.
>> [laughter]
>> You do see a lot of success in areas
like voice models from transcription to
synthesis. You don't always see
leadership from the model labs. You see
the model labs actually trying to focus
more on specific problems. For
Anthropic, I think it's coding. For
OpenAI, it's been consumer, now maybe
shifting a little bit more to
enterprise. Um for Google, definitely
consumer as well. And it really does
feel like there are still tradeoffs to
me. So, I expect there will still be
multiple architectures up until that
event horizon of AGI's here, so all bets
are off.
>> As you guys build your core agent
harnesses, and I'm assuming one to build
them in a model agnostic way, what do
you need to change to go from an OpenAI
model to an Anthropic model?
>> Usually, you have the evals that are
designed to work across both. So, if you
have really good evals and a really good
harness, a really good architecture,
then you should be able to kind of hill
climb toward eval performance without
too much effort. Often what will happen
is you'll learn the first time you're
switching one task from one to another
or making it possible to run on multiple
systems that your eval wasn't quite as
good as you thought. And so then you
make your eval better and you continue
to improve. But the short answer is that
it's pretty simple for a given
intelligence level of a model
to run a task on one or the other. And
so again it's that basically latency
quality cost trade-off, but not more
than that. And because we have customers
that have very specific requirements
around what clouds they can run in, what
models they can use, and our
company approach is to meet them, you
know, on their terms. You don't serve
most of the Fortune 20 without that
approach. It's not really a choice.
And so because that's our approach and
we've built a lot of products around
that, we also have made sure that we can
kind of move between models of
comparable intelligence without too much
heartburn.
>> And what do you end up changing when you
hill climb? Is it just the prompts? Do
you also change out some of the tools
themselves?
>> It depends on the case. And I might not
be the expert on the exact history of
each. I would I think that if you change
the tools,
it's pretty hard not to have downstream
effects of that. And there might be
certain tasks that can only run on
certain models
and other tasks that can run on other
models. And so there's always kind of a
set of eligible models for specific
tasks. I don't know exactly how tools
change, but I know the eval getting more
robust and the prompt, you know,
conforming to the quirks of each model
is definitely part of the development.
>> You guys recently wrote a blog around
context engineering and I think you said
it was the key to great agent building
or something like that. How do you guys
think about context engineering and and
and what, you know, tips or tricks would
you have for others?
>> I think it's showing agents everything
they need to do the right thing, but
nothing more.
And as models get smarter, you can be
a little bit less precise with
everything they need, and certainly less
precise with nothing more. So, early on
it was
the agent SDK was really about only
giving the model exactly what it needed
and kind of spoon-feeding the context.
Now, to extend the uh meal analogy, it's
probably more like, you know, putting
out the right dish. And maybe in the
future, it might be something that is
even less structured. One concept that I
think is in that blog post is kind of
progressive disclosure. You'll probably
know more about this than I do, but
when you bring something into the
prompt,
you don't want to do it before it's
relevant, and then you also risk
incoherence if you then yank it out of
the prompt. So, when you do things like
prompt compaction, you just want to be
really thoughtful about not making it
lossy, because if you keep something in
the history that is
incoherent with the rest of the system
prompt, it's not going to end well. And
so, I think to the degree, you know,
when we're fixing uh
issues, or when when we've seen
hallucinations, it's often because one
part of the prompt was this, and the
other part was this. And actually, one
of my main learnings from Sierra is
anytime you think the model's being
dumb, it's probably you.
>> I like that. I think that I I think a
lot of people have learned similar
lessons from doubting the model.
>> the model's too dumb, the model's
actually too smart.
>> How much you guys care about prompt
caching and maintaining that cache? I've
heard I've heard kind of like two
mindsets on it. One is like, yeah, do
everything you can to maintain the
cache, like don't invalidate it until
you like absolutely need to. And then
I've heard another theory that's
basically like, yeah, prompt caching's
great, but like what matters most is
like performance, and sometimes you need
to just like break the cache in order to
insert the right context, or give it a
system reminder, or something like that.
How how strictly do you guys try to
adhere to prompt caching?
>> Is the purpose for those who are prompt
caching loyalists for uh speed or cost
or quality?
>> I think the first two mostly speed and
cost.
>> Speed and cost.
>> Yeah. I haven't I haven't heard anyone
argue that it's for quality, but maybe
maybe it works better.
>> It's a nice to have.
Um we definitely don't want to
invalidate a cache for no good reason,
but quality comes first.
So, we aren't uh zealots about it at
all. I would also say that when the
outcomes that your agents are delivering
are very valuable, you have the luxury
of not being extremely focused on cost
in particular.
Uh and so, that probably is part of the
reason for that is that, you know,
a conversation with a customer could
sell a
$100 product or a $1,000 lifetime value
plan. And so, those are valuable enough
that quality almost always comes first.
>> We've talked a bunch about the agent
itself. There's two topics that we were
discussing earlier, and I'm curious
We've talked a little bit about them,
but I'm curious if you have any more
thoughts. First being RL. When is RL
good? When is it bad? How much have you
guys explored it?
>> We've explored it a lot, in part because
it has two great promises, you know,
increasing the ceiling of the quality of
models, and then also making it so that
you can do a similar task on more
models.
I'm curious for your take, but in
practice I've seen a little bit more of
the second one when it comes to like
enterprise RL. It's taking an open model
or open weights model and saying, "How
can we get similar performance to a
frontier model?" The two things that
make it hard are, number one, uh the way
that that gets delivered is
non-deterministic and might include um
you can't include any data that you
don't want the model to regurgitate. So,
we basically would never fine-tune a
model on something when it could lead to
regurgitation risk. That's just a
non-starter. And then also uh in
general, just the way that uh you would
train the model, you have to think about
preparing all of that data.
The other big one is that the frontier
models are improving so fast that you
want to remain as agile as possible.
And so in many cases, doing something
like RL makes a ton of sense for
something like knowledge where we feel
like we are pushing the state of the
art. But if we're not pushing the state
of the art, we really want to be
thinking about what's going to be true 3
months from now, 6 months from now, and
oftentimes RL is a rounding error
against that.
>> Yeah, I feel like to your point earlier,
we've started to hear it a little bit
more recently. I think because of cost.
So I think like most people are
interested in it when they're using
these frontier models and the
performance is good. But now, whether
it's coding or other things, their cost
is just going through the roof. I think
the and we're starting to investigate
this more, but I think the places where
we're hearing it most are basically in
those where performance is good, cost
too high. How can I bring it down? Let's
see if I can I can train a model to get
similar cost at a fraction of the cost.
Or similar performance, fraction of the
cost.
>> Yeah.
Interestingly enough, a lot of our
progress here has been driven by
capacity, not cost. Where
you know, we have a lot of customers
that are in the retail space. And when
we go into Black Friday, Cyber Monday,
for example, you need a lot of capacity
to deal with the spikes that they face.
Uh we've also done load tests that are
on the order of you know, if you were to
have that rate of conversation over a
year, it would be billions of
conversations. And so that level of
concurrency and those spikes just mean
that we need to be resilient to downtime
with a particular provider and ready
for, you know, using whoever has the
capacity to serve us. And so
it's funny because it's useful in so
many ways, but a lot of the reason why
we have such good support for multiple
providers is specifically preparing for
Black Friday Cyber Monday and running
load tests for really large customers.
>> One other
harness agent engineering topic,
multi-agent systems. Where do you think
they're useful, where they're not
useful?
>> I think they are often not as useful as
people think. My thoughts on this would
be people should be really thoughtful
about why they want a multi-agent
system. If you want a multi-agent system
so that one team can work on one agent
and one team can work on another agent,
then you're shipping your org chart. If
you want a multi-agent system because
it's just makes you more comfortable to
think about this problem over here and
this other problem over here,
then you're also not optimizing around
impact.
If, for example, you had an agent that
does triage and another agent that does
a task, by building it as a multi-agent
system,
you're often
depriving of the agent doing the task of
the information from the triage and
depriving the agent doing the triage of
all of the procedural information from
the task. And that's typically
destructive of value. And so, we are
often just want to make sure that we're
doing multi-agent systems for the right
reason. If you're kicking off even a
sub-agent, you want to make sure that it
has everything it needs to do that task
and that there's no reason why it
shouldn't just be part of the main
agent. Um and so, I think I've seen a
lot of cases where people are reaching
for multi-agent systems the same way you
might reach for microservices
uh before you're necessarily ready for
that level of optimization and also for
reasons that might not be just about
building the best possible agent. And
so, Sierra agents tend to be kind of one
agent representing the brand. You
certainly can have multiple agents and
build a multi-agent system, but be if
you're managing context correctly, if
you're doing really really good context
engineering, then typically it's just
not a problem because you're not
exposing the wrong context to the wrong
agent.
>> Is there a right time to build a
multi-agent system?
>> I think if you have truly separable
jobs, right? Where there's not any
purpose of the first context being part
of the second context.
I will say that
in my personal opinion with you know,
May 18th, 2026,
there not a lot of great times for it.
There might be times where it actually
the organizational difficulties are
worth the quality drop, but if you're
doing it specifically for quality, I
think it's it's
pretty rare that you can't just solve it
with better context engineering and I'm
kind of a monolith loyalist on that.
>> I feel like voice is one of the things
that is getting more and more popular,
but there still aren't a ton of people
doing a lot of, but you guys are. Can
you give me a voice 101 or 201? What
what should I and other agent builders
know about voice compared to just
building, you know, simple chat agents?
>> Voice has been maybe the most fun
project that I've worked on in my whole
career.
So, and and I for context, I joined
Sierra as an agent PM working on
building agents specifically with
customers in a forward deployed role.
And one of the first customers I worked
on
is SiriusXM, the in-car streaming radio
service. And so, I'm big SiriusXM fan
before that and as a result. And they
have a ton of volume over voice, even
more than they have over chat. And so,
many of their touchpoints with customers
are over the phone. And so, early on it
was very obvious that voice was going to
be impactful for the business.
And we got to think from first
principles, basically from the ground
up, what makes a voice experience great?
How is that similar to chat? How is that
similar How is that different from chat?
And so, latency is probably the most
obvious one.
You need to be really thoughtful about
parallelism. You need to be really
thoughtful about what we call progress
indicators, which is where you
say, you know, hang on a second while I
look up your account.
That's number one. Number two is
naturalism. This is a combination of a
number of different things. So,
oftentimes when something sounds a
little bit robotic,
I'll I'll read what the agent said, and
I'm like, "Well, I sound robotic, too."
So, it's a combination of what the agent
is reading and then also the quality of
the voice itself.
Um there's multilingualism. It's very
easy to speak different languages over
chat using large language models. It's a
lot harder to be fluent in I think it's
almost about 60 languages on Sierra
platform um and
you know, than it is on chat. And each
of those languages, you know, sometimes
the very best transcription provider
might have a 20% word error rate. I
think that's true for a language like
Hungarian, for example. And so, it's
like, how can we ensemble multiple
transcription providers in order to get
that down and kind of be better than a
single model is on its own. The other
big factor is I think we all believe
that a few years from now
most voice agents will be running voice
native models. So, you know, real time I
think it they might be up to 2.5 at this
point. They've had like three big
real-time launches at OpenAI this year
already. There was the really cool demo
from Thinking Machines Labs as well. So,
there's been a lot of increased momentum
here.
And as of a few months ago, we now have
production agents live with the
voice-to-voice models. Um and so,
they're you know, it's you know, fully
end-to-end doing that. You still need
the transcript in order to like make API
calls and that sort of thing, but the
agent is responding you know,
with audio as the input. The other big
piece of it, I think the The Machines
demo was a really good example.
Up until now, we basically had like 50
lines of Python. I think Silero is the
most popular voice activity detection
library
deciding when to speak.
And then a trillion parameters deciding
what to say. And that balance feels very
off to me. If you think about the
conversation we're having right now,
I'm actually using a lot of my brain
power to decide when to speak
uh in addition to decide what deciding
what to say. And it's probably more like
50/50.
And so the one of the big unlocks for
Sierra agents was deciding to think
about not only how to parallelize a
task, but how to parallelize thinking,
listening, and talking.
So that when I'm listening, I'm already
thinking about what I might say next.
When I'm talking, I'm listening for
interruptions. And so that was a big
unlock uh in terms of the product
design. The other one I would say is
just modularity, like I said earlier.
Um no one is the best at everything in
this space. And when there are, you
know, 100-plus languages uh worldwide
that, you know, really deliver
meaningful results, when many of our
customers are global brands, global
companies, you need that flexibility to
use one provider here and another
provider there and to ensemble them
together in a specific place as well.
>> How much of that modularity and that
parallelism and thinking about different
things goes away when it's like a native
voice-to-voice model?
>> In one specific conversation,
it goes away.
But if you think about the businesses we
serve, the voice-to-voice models today
are just reaching a level of reliability
where you would trust them for English.
And so if you still want to support all
the different languages, you need that
modularity for the foreseeable future.
Um the other thing is they're still
almost an order of magnitude more
expensive. They aren't quite as good at
reasoning yet.
And so the cases where they are live in
production, they're not quite as
reliable with tool calling and
instruction following. The cases where
they're live in production, it's cases
where we know in advance that the
journey is a little bit simpler.
And where the naturalism matters even
more than usual.
And the procedure is not as complex as
some other cases. And so it's still I
would say a fraction of our market that
we can use voice-to-voice models for.
>> My perception also, and I I have never
built a voice agent. So I know truly
nothing here. But my perception here is
for the voice-to-voice models, you you
probably you have less control over what
goes on inside of the loop basically of
of tool calling and reasoning. Is that
correct or are there pretty good
controls for for what happens inside?
>> You may not have built a voice model,
but you're an expert in developer
ergonomics. And I would say early on
the APIs missed the mark on the
ergonomics. And so they got the uh
integration points wrong. And they were
it was exactly what you said. It was
hey, if you want our model
you need our voice activity detection
and you need the whole thing. There was
still an underlying model that was
available. So I'm, you know, dating
myself in AI, but the GPT-4 audio model
was extremely exciting. It did things
that no model before it could do. I
think maybe like people that are real AI
OGs would say this about like GPT-2 or
something. And so you could see that
this was coming. And I think we all
would have said 5 years from now this is
where we're going to be.
But the way that we wired that up in our
system was basically
using the entire Sierra pipeline.
And then holding on to the input audio.
And piping that in with all of the
prompt context into the audio model to
do the last mile. So we were basically
still doing everything ourselves and
using it for the last mile. I think
you're right that over time there's more
and that you can do with the audio model
the same way there's more that you can
do with the text models. The fallacy
would be that okay, so then you don't
need the harness or you don't need all
of the orchestration and simulations and
everything because
you can make that choice. You can either
do the same thing a little bit more
easily or you can set your sights on new
and more impressive things. Which I
think not to get too philosophical, but
that's kind of the direction of the
industry in general. It's like are we
all obsolete or are we going to find new
things to do that raise our horizons
even farther?
>> If you had to guestimate a time, we're
big into guestimating on the podcast
apparently.
>> Great.
>> Um, when do you when do you think more
than 50% of your either traffic or
customers will be served by a
voice-to-voice model as opposed to this
this speech-to-text text-to-speech
pipeline?
>> I will be surprised if it happens in the
next 18 months. I've been surprised
before. I was surprised by Opus 4.5
uh, late last year. Um, certainly
surprised by ChatGPT. Like vividly
remember the first time
staying up till 3:00 a.m. just, you
know,
trying to jailbreak the prompt.
>> [laughter]
>> And so, you know, I I know you're a
sports fan, too. So, if we're doing
over/unders, it would be like 24 months
and 1 day or something like that. You
know, like or over/under 24 months would
be probably my my personal guess.
Demation.
>> How, if at all, do you guys think about
memory? Specifically long-term memory,
specific It sounds like you've got users
potentially interacting with multiple
different agents that your your that a
single brand can can be building. How do
you think about the memory that's shared
across them?
>> Memory is very important to the
platform.
So, I mentioned the agent data platform
earlier, which kind of brings together
uh,
machine learning data or, you know, big
data as you might say about about
customers and then marries that with in
the moment context. That can only happen
if you have a sense of identity and can
also bring in
memory from the past. So, in every
Sierra conversation, there's the
possibility of
identifying the customer, saving
memories either implicitly automatically
or explicitly, and then extracting those
memories at a future date for use in the
agent. So, it's very much first-class
primitive on the platform.
I think you'll see that happen more and
more over time as well. Just as these
journeys get more complex, as we see
more and more wins from the personal
touch. We already have a number of cases
where resolution rate has gone up
meaningfully from memory, whether it's
just greeting you by name, remembering
what you called about last time, knowing
that yesterday you were on the phone for
an hour and it was really frustrating.
And so,
early on we had that memory through
customer systems only, but we found just
from customers asking over and over,
"Hey, can you just have this first-class
on the platform?" that it's helpful to
have both. Seamless integrations with a
CRM
as well as on platform memory that
really understands AI better than most
CRM software does.
>> How do you guys think about memory? I
feel like you've got agents, multiple
agents interacting with customers
throughout various stages of their
buying experience life cycle. So, I
imagine memory must be important. How
How do you guys think about it?
>> So, memory is extremely important to the
platform and since the agent data
platform introduction, which we launched
back in early November,
it's been a first-class primitive on
Sierra. So, if you call, for example, my
wife lived in Hawaii for a year and so I
was flying Hawaiian Airlines back and
forth quite a bit and on a couple
occasions, for anyone who's brought a
dog to Hawaii, there's a lot of
paperwork involved. I'm excited for the
Sierra agent that can help with that.
But, I would often add a pet in cabin,
not that often, a couple times. And if I
call back, you know, it's nice for them
to remember why I'm calling, to know
about me, to know I prefer aisle seats.
I'm a big user of the in-flight
internet. Hawaiian has Starlink back and
forth from Hawaii.
And so,
these things just what we've seen in
practice is that if you know who someone
is, you greet them by name, you remember
what's important to them, and you show
empathy in the moment, it increases all
of the metrics that are most important
to businesses, from resolution rate to
conversion rate, etc. And so, we've made
memory first class on the Sierra
platform, where during a conversation,
implicitly or explicitly, you can
basically store memories.
And then, the agent, if the same person
calls back, can extract those memories.
The one thing to be aware of is you have
to be really thoughtful about
authentication, because often times, if
someone calls over the phone,
you don't necessarily know 100% from
their phone number that it is this
person. You know, some office networks
all have the same phone number, maybe
it's a family line, etc. And so, every
business has to think about what the
policy is for allowing the extraction of
memories, and which memories are
sensitive versus not so sensitive.
Saying, "Hey Harrison, thanks for
calling again." You know, that's
probably fine. But, if it's like, "Hey
Harrison, and are you calling about your
social security number or the you know,
that's like a definitely a different
standard. Um and so, we try to be very
thoughtful about that with our customers
as well.
>> When you say you can implicitly or
explicitly save memories, what what
exactly does that mean?
>> So, there's kind of three layers of it.
Number one is on a given conversation
turn, you could say, "I want to save
this to memory."
Number two would be at the beginning of
a conversation, you could say, "These
are the things that are important to
remember." You know, "Remember their
birthday." That's always nice. Uh I
remember Cold Stone Creamery growing up,
they would give you a free scoop on your
birthday. You know, it's a great
opportunity for a brand loyalty.
>> you could say, so would the brand say,
would the customer say this in the
system prompt, or would this be the end
customer talking to the agent saying,
"Hey, remember for future things that my
birthday is on XYZ."
>> So, the first one you said would be an
example of journey building. An example
of what I just said, and you would do it
in journey building. You'd say, "I care
about birthdays as an agent developer."
Or an agent builder at any one of our
customer companies. The second thing you
said would be the third category of
memory, which would be just sort of
remember important things, and it would
be an important thing if the customer
said, "Hey, I want you to remember this
when I call back in the future."
Um so, whether you're deciding something
in the moment this is important as an
agent builder, I care about these
things, or you know, let the agent
decide. Uh those are kind of three ways
to structure uh memory storage.
>> And when you think about the structure
of memory itself, do you guys think
about it as a knowledge graph, a vector
store, a file system, TBD?
>> It's not super important. Um I guess I
would say you want to optimize around
retrieval.
But, the reason why I said it's not
super important is that typically your
knowledge base is three orders of
magnitude larger than the memories for
an individual customer.
And so,
the retrieval and ranking problem is
pretty simple, and I don't think it
matters what structure you use, at least
in our system today.
>> I feel like memory is this really hot
topic, and everyone loves to talk about
it. And And there have been memory
startups now for like 2 years, but but I
don't see any of them
being massive breakout successful. Why
is that? Is Is memory not that important
in the grand scheme of things? Is it so
bespoke? Is it just too early on? Is it
Is it really hard? Like why why isn't
there a more established memory company
or memory pattern?
>> Do you have it turned on with Claude or
ChatGPT?
>> Not on purpose, although I think it is
accidentally.
>> And do you find it useful with your
accidental turning it on?
>> I don't really there.
>> Okay. I ask because I would say that
those are useful to me. I think what I
said earlier about how when you're
trusting us with memory, you're trusting
us with authentication. That's part of
it is that actually in order to pull off
memory,
you need to be trusted with something
that has higher risk, you know, as well.
And so, the reason I mentioned ChatGPT
and Claude is those are products that
you are already trusting. And so, I
think they have more freedom than a B2B
player would have where it's like, "Hey,
if I want to buy memory from you,
I also need to buy authentication or
verification at least or identification
at least from you. And I don't know
exactly what the startups are in the
space, but I would imagine like
you're biting off more than you think
when you sell memory."
>> Talking about observability and evals
for a bit. You guys have an interesting
problem, I presume, where you have evals
for your internal agents and for the
maybe like general purpose agent SDK,
but then I'm assuming your customers
want to do evals themselves as well. Are
those the same? Do you use the same
tools for both? Or if they're different,
why and how are they different?
>> Typically not exactly the same. So,
internally, um the Agent OS, you know,
if you think about it as a series of
tasks and some of those tasks might be
very complex and some of those tasks
might be more simple.
The eval problem is more similar to the
eval problem that any applied AI company
has.
When you think about our customers,
I think the eval problem is much more
complicated and involves things like
what happens when there's background
noise in voice and uh what if I have an
adversarial user and I want to save
these 20 personas and run all of my
simulations against all 20 of the
personas and make sure that it works.
And so, you end up with just a more
complicated topography because a
conversation by nature is very
complicated and can go in so many
different directions. And so, we built a
product specifically for our customers
to eval agents called simulations. And
it supports all of these different
things. I think it is probably you can
tell when someone's building an agent if
they have good simulations, it's such a
great unlock because you can make
changes in a way that is constantly
improving the agent and being sure that
you're not regressing, especially as you
get into big teams with complex agents
that are doing so many things. I mean, I
know you see this at LangChain as well.
Like, having really good evals is such a
great unlock. And so, we pride
ourselves, in addition to, you know,
government governance and collaboration
and review and making sure that, you
know, you have workspaces, so you can
let Ghostwriter run free but still
review it before you make any changes.
We also have that simulation layer, so
that every change you make is tested
against all the assumptions of the
platform across voice and chat and many
languages and many personas in this
high-dimensional space that you're going
to experience in production.
>> Going out from evals for just a second
because you said something around
continually improving the agent. I want
to talk about continual learning. That
also ties into memory, I guess, a little
bit. Like, how do you how do you think
about continual learning in general?
Does the Sierra platform support it in a
fully I'm assuming not like completely
automated way, but like how how far
along are you guys and and and what do
you think the future in continual
learning holds?
>> Where we are today is
you can automatically detect an issue
with a monitor. Ghostwriter can
automatically suggest a fix to an issue.
And you can review that issue and push
it to your agent. And so, you're still
in the loop or people are still in the
loop in all of the cases.
But, it's
as automated as it can be with still
giving you authority over that.
I think in the near future, you will
start to see the first cases of Sierra
agents improving themselves where they
have a confidence level to the fix. For
example, if there's an error in a
knowledge article and it can tell that
there's a contradiction and it can go
check the website and, you know, for
whatever reason, it's very clear what
the true answer is, it could it could
give you an FYI instead of needing
approval. Same way, I do some work, I
ask for approval, I do some other work,
I give FYI. And so, all of the
primitives are there, it's just around
the confidence that people have in the
level of control that they want to have.
And so, we also don't want to get ahead
of our skis there. Most of our
customers, they want to review every
change that goes into the agent. This is
a really important part of their
business. We don't want to pull the
future forward too quickly. Um, we want
to move at the pace our customers are
excited about.
>> One of the things you mentioned, going
back to the eval's is monitors. What are
monitors? And then you guys also wrote a
blog called monitoring the monitors or
something like that. I'd be curious to
hear about that.
>> Yeah, we have a saying in the company
that the solution to all problems with
AI is more AI. And so, often times, you
have something that's 90% accurate and
you figure out how to verify it 90% of
the time. Figure out how to verify that
90% of the time. And and so on and so on
and you have something that's, you know,
three or four nines of reliability. And
I think with non-deterministic systems,
that's just quite a bit about how it
works. And so, similarly,
uh, with a conversation platform, you
can set up monitors that run on every
conversation and look out for the things
that you want to flag either for review
or to create issues from, uh, etc. And
it just basically gives you peace of
mind, narrows the set of, "Hey, I don't
have to wake up every morning and try to
read 10,000 conversations. I can read
five. And I can say, 'Okay, these five
look good. I feel comfortable going on
with my day."
And so, that frees up a lot of our
customers to think about how do I
actually improve customer satisfaction
or resolution rate or some of these more
strategic levers
as opposed to feeling like they need to
review everything. So, I think that's
why it's one of our more popular
features.
>> You guys released TaoBench, which is an
eval for a few different agentic use
cases. And I think you released a few
other benches as well. Why do you guys
invest in these and why should people
check them out?
>> So, I mentioned we have a research team
and
it's very exciting when you're building
something to also think about how other
people could use it. I mean, the
distance that the AI space has come and
how we've benefited just from all of the
contributions to open source, you know,
our knowledge engine as as I mentioned
runs on open models that we fine-tuned.
It has felt like one of the areas where
we can contribute because we actually
know a lot about what it takes to build
a good voice agent. I don't think anyone
knows more than we do. We know a lot
about knowledge retrieval, we know a lot
about tool calling and following
process.
Um and we know a lot about
transcription. Um and so, we've released
I think those are the four areas. There
might be another one where we release
benchmarks in the sort of Tao cinematic
universe. There's TaoVoice,
TaoKnowledge, TaoBench, and MuBench,
which is the multilingual transcription
benchmark.
And so,
it really just started because the first
TaoBench was a lot more popular than we
expected. We're like, "Oh, people trust
us to kind of say what good looks like
in this space." And so, we've continued
to do more and more, and our research
team has grown, and there's appetite. I
think it also has this ancillary benefit
of causing us to think about these
problems
in a very principled way. And you know,
from kind of the first principles of
what good looks like.
And then we can evaluate our agents that
way as well. So, I think it has that
benefit, but it is very path dependent
on Tow bench being a hit and you know,
Tow is squared being the sequel being a
hit as well and then us just deciding,
okay, let's do more of this. People seem
to like it.
>> How much does the core agent team use
these to guide their harness choices?
>> Most of the benchmarks we use to
evaluate providers
more than to evaluate agents. And so,
for example, we had there's a really
exciting new transcription model that
came by the office and presented it to
us.
And so, we were able to say, this looks
really exciting, but we'd like you to
run it against Mu bench and then it will
be really exciting. And so, it really
helps in the modular approach that we've
taken. Like, the reason we discovered
that this model works really well when
there's silence in northern United
Kingdom, but this other model works
really well when there's speech is
because of things like Mu bench in
particular for that one. Internally,
simulations is the main way that we eval
the actual agents that are going out to
production. So, it's just too customer
specific for us to rely on something as
general as a benchmark.
>> How do you create these benchmarks? Are
they synthetically generated? Do you do
a lot of data labeling internally? Do
you outsource it?
>> I think it's a mix of all three.
I don't know all of the details for all
of the benchmarks, but I know that we
do a lot of stuff internally just in
terms of especially when you're kind of
in the zero to one phase, just figuring
out what the right shape of the data is.
Even when you work with external
companies, they often want to see some
number of examples from you. And then I
think also
being able to synthesize data when scale
matters a lot especially if you can do
it in a reliable way, is very helpful,
too.
It's harder for something like
transcription where audio synthesis
might be, you know, already in the
training set of the transcription and
that kind of thing.
Um, but for things like text, I think
it's easier.
>> One of the things that I think is pretty
underrated in building agents is UX. So,
we've already talked about voice as a
modality. We've talked about actually
showing up as a chat GPT app. How else
do you guys think about modalities or
UX's? Do you have you experimented with
generative UI in any form?
>> We have quite a bit. I think it's pretty
vertical dependent as well.
To give you an example, when you're
checking in for a flight,
if you have a hypothetically 12-letter
last name with a hyphen in the middle of
it, um, and a first name that's hard to
spell as well,
hypothetically, then it might be helpful
to type that in while you're on the
phone. And so, we see in industries like
airlines appetite for multimodal
experiences, especially when there's a
lot of reservation retrieval or input.
For something like retail, we see
exactly what you described, where really
polished UI around product discovery,
um, and around recommendation moves the
needle and makes a difference.
I think where Sierra is particularly
differentiated is going really deep with
customers, especially in specific areas,
and learning, you know, what does it
mean to build an amazing
retail discovery experience, and then
just from first principles, what's the
agent that could help drive that? versus
what does it mean to build a great
airline check-in experience or flight
disruption experience, um, to the degree
that can be great, it can be not
terrible, I guess. Then, you know,
what's the right form factor for that?
We've seen, and I think one of the
reasons vertical companies have been
pretty successful lately is that
understanding the contours of each
industry and each company really makes a
difference.
>> One of the things that I think you guys
are actually best known for is your
revenue model, and charging for
outcome-based pricing.
How do you actually do that? How do you
estimate the the value that an
interaction has? And And is it specific
to each customer?
>> This, I think, is maybe the number one
operational reason or business reason
why ICR has been successful. It aligns
the incentives between
our company and our customers. And I
think the phrase I like to use, which is
a little bit cheeky, probably, is if you
don't understand the value of
outcome-based pricing, your outcomes are
probably not that valuable. Because when
you're delivering, you know, $100
outcomes, and you get to keep a portion
of it,
everyone wants to row in the same
direction, and it cuts through all of
the prioritization and decision-making
that often will cloud and resource
allocation that often will will cloud
enterprise partnerships. So, it's
extremely valuable, and I think it's a
big reason why we've been successful. I
think it will just become the norm for
companies that are doing differentiated
high-value activities. If your product
really like feels a little bit more like
a commodity,
you'll start to see more usage-based and
seat-based pricing, cuz it's just
simpler. An area, for example,
knowledge-based lookups are a little bit
more that way, just question answering.
And so, in the case of question
answering, that's not an area where you
would have a high premium for an outcome
of any particular sort. But if it's
making a sale on a membership, or you
know, selling someone a car,
that's a really big outcome. Um, and so,
companies will be more than happy to pay
for that.
Uh, I think where we're seeing things
going is intra-conversation outcomes, to
also thinking about more, you know, as I
mentioned, kind of the moments that
matter across the customer life cycle,
and driving outcomes on top of our agent
data platform that kind of span that
whole life cycle. I think that's
particularly interesting.
>> You guys support multiple different
outcomes. So, you've got customer
support and you've got sales. How
different is the pricing between those
and how many different of these like
categories or templates do you guys end
up having?
>> It really depends on the value. So, you
asked if it was customer specific. The
answer ends up being that it sort of has
to be. In certain cases, you are
troubleshooting very complex setup to a
device or something and you have to try
15 different things to get it to work
and the average conversation might take
20 turns and the amount of, you know,
context engineering to make that work
might be very high.
In other cases, you might have something
where, you know, you're just resetting
the signal on your TV and it's very
quick and easy or you're checking your
balance with the bank and that's very
easy. And so, you know, one outcome is
very valuable and drives a lot of
loyalty and one outcome is somewhat
commoditized. You might have some cases
where there's, you know, an outcome
that's tens of dollars
and in terms of the, you know, money
that the agent would earn
and then you might have some cases where
it's, you know, much, much lower than
that.
>> And does that ever differ
within a customer? So, like in your
example, I could imagine you you could
have an agent doing a really simple task
of, oh, tell them to unplug the computer
and plug it back in or something like
that. And there's another one where
like, oh my god, who knows what's going
wrong and and it like is a miracle that
it solves it at all. If it's the same
customer, will it be charged the same
amount or do you differentiate even
within those different types of
requests?
>> There are cases where we differentiate.
We're not dogmatic about it. What we
found is that often times the benefits
of having our incentives aligned
are so high that it's not worth
negotiating every detail of what counts
for what and it kind of even out over
time and you do right by your customers
over time and you build trust and
contracts aren't infinite and you want
to have a really high renewal rate and
have them trust you with more use cases
and these kinds of things. So we make
sure that incentives are deeply aligned.
And then on top of that I think you can
get really pedantic about the
engineering of specific outcomes and
maybe over time the market will move in
that direction. But I think you're
missing the forest for the trees in that
case because of just how powerful the
concept is. And so most of our customers
are eager to find something simple that
we all understand that feels fair. As
opposed to trying to engineer like the
perfect value for the for each outcome.
>> Why don't you think there's more outcome
based pricing right now? Is it because
there's not enough agents doing valuable
things or because it's so operationally
intensive for now cuz it's early on that
you guys have just a built up muscle of
doing it and that's what allows you guys
to do it so effectively.
>> I think it's probably a bit of both. I
think that there are a lot of products
that
probably as models have improved find
themselves in a position of being more
similar to
what you could just buy tokens and
create and then also there's just we're
very early here.
If I had to say though I would guess
that the second one is more important
and there will be a lot more of this the
same way someone doesn't care how many
hours I work as long as I produce you
know new products that are good.
And I think that that will become true
of agents as well. There will be a mix
of building agents in house on platforms
like LangGraph and then there will be
also
you know buying
products like Sierra to build agents on.
>> Maybe switching to the last topic which
is just the type of people that thrive
at Sierra. I think you guys are also
pretty famously known for your forward
deployed engineering or agent builder
approach. Could you talk a little bit
about that both in terms of what those
people do as well as the right persona
to grow into that role?
>> I joined Sierra about 2 and 1/2 years
ago and it was my first B2B job ever.
I'd only worked in consumer products and
I love building consumer products. I
love being like, oh, I could imagine,
you know, my friends using this or my
parents using this, but I'd never really
loved growth
uh and the idea of figuring out how to
drive a couple percentage points of
attention or a couple percentage points
of usage. And what I learned when I
joined Sierra is I love enterprise
sales.
Uh
>> [laughter]
>> I got a tattoo.
Um so, basically, the the process of
caring about each customer individually,
saying one customer is upset, I'm going
to call them right now and find out why
and see how I can help. Just felt very
empowering as a builder in a way where
building for a billion users on Google
Search, for example, you know, it was
exciting in other ways, but it didn't
feel like you could listen to each user
and help them. And in many cases, we
have customers of Sierra that have, you
know, gotten promoted in their
organizations. They're building careers
because of the agents that they built on
Sierra and so it's just feels very deep
in terms of those relationships.
What I love as well though is that the
end user of a Sierra agent is still a
consumer in the vast majority of cases.
And I think it's pretty rare to have a
product that needs to be consumer grade
where the product that you're building,
it's a it's a platform, but then the end
user is really a consumer and you have
to have them in your mind the whole
time, but where you have kind of the
enterprise sales process of building
trust, of solving problems, of
discovering value, and then delivering
that value for people.
Um and so, I think the people that
really appreciate those two things, the
customer obsession and the
craftsmanship,
uh, do very well.
I think we've also discovered just with
the rise of coding agents, certain
things are more important than they used
to be. Deep customer intuition, GPT-5.5
doesn't really have that.
Um, agency, the ability to say, "Why
can't I do this?" Um, one of our uh,
engineers that has really high degree of
agency, her status message is just like,
"Why not today?"
Um, and so, yeah, having that mindset, I
think is really important. And then the
other thing just as someone with a
product background is I think we kind of
have
a faster car than you need more pit
stops, kind of thing. So, like a a
Formula 1 car needs to get its tires
changed more often than my Hyundai Kona.
Uh, and the reason for that is, you
know, it's driving faster, it's burning
more rubber, uh, etc. And I think we
have a similar thing building products
as well now where coding agents have
allowed us to write code a lot faster
and even to review it faster now. But
certain things like product judgment and
customer intuition are therefore
actually needed more often, not less
often. And so, uh, people that can bring
that to the table themselves are in this
amazing loop of moving fast, but people
where it's one person's job to bring
that and another person's job to do
engineering, they need even tighter
collaboration and, you know, more daily
stand-ups and that kind of thing to be
successful.
>> I really like that car analogy. I hadn't
heard that before and totally resonates
with what what what I'm seeing where
product is becoming the bottleneck
because it's so easy to code and you can
make so much of things, but that doesn't
mean you should. Who ends up fitting
this agent builder profile the best? Is
this product people then? Is this
engineers with good product intuition?
Like what does it look like practically?
We're still figuring it out.
>> I will say that people that have done
both roles are often successful in the
company. Our head of engineering, Arya,
has been a product manager in the past.
We have a number of engineers that have
been product managers. I think those
skills, knowing how to talk to
customers, not just like what to say
when you're in front of a customer, but
how to find your way into the right
conversations, having a high degree of
agency, being really strong with
communication, so that you're getting,
you know, product isn't the bottleneck
anymore. Uh those are really important
skills.
I still think kind of knowing the right
questions to ask and the right things to
tell coding agents is really important.
So, the systems thinking and the
architecture design are really
important. And so, if you
have not been an engineer before, uh it
can be difficult. And so, I I think that
the multi-disciplinary approach is more
important than ever. My own personal
rubric, which is like very much in beta,
is kind of this customer intuition,
agency, product judgment,
technical depth,
communication, intensity. Because when
the car, you know, you need to be really
locked in when you're driving a Formula
1 car. Um and then one which is a little
harder to pin down, but it's just kind
of leadership, where when there's more
activity going on, the ability to to
draw it into the correct direction is
really important as well. So, this is
kind of the working framework in my
head, um but I'm sure there are lots of
other things, too.
>> How do you interview for agency? And I
asked this because I think the the guest
we had on in the previous episode said
the exact same word agency for one of
the traits that they look at. And I
asked him the same question. So, now I'm
going to ask you the same question. How
do you How do you interview for agency?
>> So, the most concrete way that we've
changed our interviewing process is we
have this AI native interview.
>> And you wrote a great blog on it the
other week.
>> Yes. And so,
you, by the way, is Vijay and Arya and
our uh engineering leaders. But I've
seen it done and participated in the
interview panels. And basically it
involves building a product end-to-end
over the course of a few hours and then
reviewing it with the team.
I think in that environment you can see
what people think is off-limits or
what's their job and what's not their
job and how far they extend sort of what
they're allowed to do.
And if they're able to
find opportunities that you would have
thought, oh, maybe that they would think
that's out of scope, bring them into
scope and build build great products on
top of it. You kind of see agency. You
see that they have a sense that a lot is
in their control instead of feeling like
certain things are not in their control.
And if you think about coding agents,
they bring so much more into I think the
like the locus of control, right? And so
you can do more things and if you
appreciate that, I think it comes
through in that AI-native interview.

## Key Takeaways

- **Agentic commerce will be bigger than e-commerce** — personal agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Codex) will be the primary interface for commercial transactions; brands need agent presences just as they needed websites. Sierra invested in [[concepts/isolated-infrastructure|PCI DSS Level 1 isolated payment infrastructure]] years before it made sense because they believe in this thesis.
- **"The best AI agents are simpler than you think"** — the core thesis of the talk: production agents at scale don't need elaborate [[concepts/sub-agents|multi-agent architectures]]. Better [[concepts/context-window-management|context engineering]] in a single agent ("monolith loyalist") usually outperforms splitting into triage+task agents, which "deprives the task agent of triage context and the triage agent of procedure context."
- **Voice changes everything** — latency (1-2s response required) forces architectural decisions that chat agents can skip: [[concepts/speculative-execution|speculative execution]] (classify and respond in parallel), [[concepts/model-ensembling|model ensembling]] (run two transcription models, trust the silence-conservative one), and progress indicators. The harness for voice diverges structurally from the coding-agent harness.
- **Constellation of models beats one-model-to-rule-them-all** — Sierra invokes 10-15 models per conversation turn: frontier models for reasoning, in-house fine-tuned models for knowledge retrieval, and cheap classifiers for intent detection. Multi-provider support is driven by capacity resilience (Black Friday spikes) more than cost optimization.
- **No-code agent building works when compilation is deterministic** — Sierra's "journeys" layer compiles deterministically and isomorphically to Agent SDK code. LLM-as-compiler was tried and rejected: "all of the experiments we've done in that direction, you end up with more harm than good." The target audience is operations teams (who know SOPs), not engineering teams.
- **Outcome-based pricing aligns incentives** — charging per resolved outcome (sale, support resolution, membership conversion) rather than per seat or per usage. "If you don't understand the value of outcome-based pricing, your outcomes are probably not that valuable."
- **Memory requires trust infrastructure** — Sierra makes memory a first-class platform primitive with implicit/explicit storage and authentication-gated retrieval. The reason memory startups haven't broken out: "to sell memory, you must also sell authentication." Consumer products (ChatGPT, Claude) have an advantage because users already trust them.
- **Evals get better through model switching stress** — switching models exposes gaps in your eval suite. Sierra uses [[concepts/simulations|simulations]] (multi-persona, multi-language, adversarial, voice-noise) for customer-facing evals and benchmarks ([[entities/taobench|TaoBench]]) for provider evaluation.

## Concepts

- [[concepts/agentic-commerce]] — thesis that agent-mediated commerce will surpass e-commerce; personal agents as the interface
- [[concepts/outcome-based-pricing]] — pricing model aligned to resolved outcomes rather than seats/usage
- [[concepts/constellation-of-models]] — 10-15 model calls per conversation turn across frontier, in-house, and classifier tiers
- [[concepts/speculative-execution]] — parallel inference paths (classify + respond + pre-fetch) for sub-second latency
- [[concepts/model-ensembling]] — running multiple models on the same input, selecting best per-segment output
- [[concepts/voice-agents]] — agent architecture for voice: latency, parallelism, naturalism, multilingualism
- [[concepts/voice-to-voice-models]] — native audio-to-audio models vs. STT+TTS pipeline; 18-24 months from majority adoption
- [[concepts/isolated-infrastructure]] — PCI DSS Level 1 compliant payment processing separate from LLM calls
- [[concepts/simulations]] — multi-persona, multi-language, adversarial eval product for agent testing
- [[concepts/no-code-agent-building]] — declarative agent authoring with deterministic code compilation
- [[concepts/continual-learning]] — detect → suggest → review → deploy loop with confidence-gated automation
- [[concepts/forward-deployed-engineering]] — engineers embedded with customer teams building agents alongside domain experts
- [[concepts/context-window-management]] — "show everything they need, nothing more"; progressive disclosure timing
- [[concepts/sub-agents]] — multi-agent skepticism; Explorer (analysis) + Ghostwriter (authoring) as separate agents
- [[concepts/agent-memory]] — first-class memory with implicit/explicit storage and authentication-gated retrieval
- [[concepts/agent-evals]] — monitors as always-on evaluators; simulations as customer-facing eval product
- [[concepts/tool-use]] — voice-to-voice model tool-calling limitations; agent reasoning reducing tool prerequisites
- [[concepts/frameworks-vs-libraries]] — "meet the models on their turf"; deterministic no-code→code compilation
- [[concepts/harness-engineering]] — SDK rebuilt 2-3 times as models improve; model-agnostic harness via evals

## Entities

- [[entities/sierra]] — company: customer experience agent platform for Fortune 20; voice-first, outcome-priced, PCI-certified
- [[entities/taobench]] — project: Sierra's benchmark suite (TaoBench, TaoVoice, TaoKnowledge, MuBench)

## Connections

- **Monolith loyalism vs. multi-agent orthodoxy** — Zack's skepticism about multi-agent systems ([[concepts/sub-agents]]) converges with Dex Horthy's "sub-agents are for context control, not anthropomorphizing roles." Both see multi-agent as over-applied. The Sierra exception: Explorer + Ghostwriter as genuinely separable agents (analysis vs. authoring).
- **Deterministic compilation as scaffolding** — Sierra's deterministic no-code-to-code compilation ([[concepts/no-code-agent-building]]) is the production instantiation of [[concepts/frameworks-vs-libraries|scaffolding over wrappers]]. Code and no-code are isomorphic; builders can drop to code when needed.
- **Evals as the model-switching mechanism** — [[entities/sierra|Sierra]]'s insight that "switching models exposes eval gaps" connects [[concepts/agent-evals]] to [[concepts/harness-engineering]]: evals are not just quality measurement but the infrastructure that makes the harness model-agnostic.
- **Voice harness ≠ coding harness** — the latency constraint creates genuine architectural divergence, challenging the assumption that agent harnesses will converge. [[concepts/voice-agents]] and coding-agent harnesses ([[concepts/agent-harness]]) share models and tool access but have fundamentally different execution loops.
- **Memory ⇄ Trust** — Sierra's authentication-gated memory ([[concepts/agent-memory]]) and isolated payment infrastructure ([[concepts/isolated-infrastructure]]) are two sides of the same architectural pattern: drawing security boundaries around sensitive data that the LLM cannot touch.
- **Product judgment as the new bottleneck** — "a faster car needs more pit stops" ([[concepts/harness-engineering]]): as coding agents accelerate execution, the human skills of product judgment and customer intuition become the scarcer resource, not engineering throughput.
