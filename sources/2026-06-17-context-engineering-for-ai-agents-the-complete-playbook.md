Your AI agent works great for the first 10 steps.

Then somewhere around step 15, it starts getting sloppy.

Wrong tool calls. Forgetting your original instructions. Low-quality outputs.

Most people blame the model.

It's almost never the model.

It's what the model is seeing.

Organizing what the model sees is called **context engineering**.

It is quickly becoming the most important skill for anyone building AI agents.

Here is the complete playbook.

## Prompt engineering is dead. Context engineering is what matters now.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_1phNboAAYxSV?format=jpg&name=large)

You've heard of prompt engineering.

Writing clear instructions. Good examples. Telling the model what role to play.

That works perfectly for a chatbot.

It stops working the moment you build an agent.

Here's why.

A chatbot answers one question and stops.

An agent takes actions — browsing the web, calling APIs, writing code, running commands — step after step after step, sometimes for dozens of steps.

Every single step produces output that gets added to the model's context.

And that context is finite.

Anthropic's engineering team defines it like this:

"Context is the set of tokens included when you sample from an LLM. Context engineering is optimizing the utility of those tokens to consistently achieve a desired outcome."

Put simply: make sure your agent sees the right information, in the right format, at the right time.

Prompt engineering is a subset of context engineering.

Context engineering is everything.

## Your agent's context window is RAM. And it's filling up.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_1uE9aQAAQLO1?format=jpg&name=large)

LangChain has the right analogy for this.

Think of an LLM like a new kind of operating system.

The model is the CPU — it does the thinking.

The context window is RAM — the working memory where everything the model can currently see and reason about lives.

Just like your computer slows down when RAM fills up, your agent's reasoning degrades when the context window gets crowded.

This is called **context rot**.

Chroma ran a study evaluating 18 frontier models — GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, Qwen3, and others.

Every single model's performance degraded as input length increased.

Not at the hard limit. Well before it.

A model with a 200K-token window might show significant degradation at 50K tokens.

The decline is continuous. Not a cliff.

Why? Transformers work by having every token attend to every other token — creating n-squared relationships. As context grows, the model's ability to hold all those relationships thins out.

And then there's the "Lost in the Middle" problem.

LLMs show a U-shaped attention curve.

→ Beginning of context: remembered well

→ End of context: remembered well

→ Middle: largely ignored

Researchers measured a 30+ percentage point accuracy drop when relevant information moved from the beginning of context to the middle.

Your original instructions — buried under 50,000 tokens of tool outputs — effectively disappear.

Claude Code users have found output quality degrades at **40–60% of context capacity**. Well before any hard limit.

## What's actually competing for space in your agent's context

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_14BJb0AAberS?format=jpg&name=large)

7 categories. All fighting for the same finite window.

**1\. System Prompt**

The agent's identity. Behavioral rules. Control flow logic. Instructions for different task types. In an agent, this isn't just "be helpful." It can define the entire architecture.

**2\. Tool Definitions**

Every tool the agent could call needs a schema describing what it does, what parameters it takes, and when to use it.

**3\. Tool Call Results**

Every tool call adds its output to context. A web page retrieval: 5,000–10,000 tokens. A file read: similar. These accumulate fast.

**4\. Retrieved Knowledge (RAG)**

Documents pulled from vector databases, search results, API responses — anything retrieved to inform the agent's decisions.

**5\. Conversation History**

The full transcript of everything that's happened. User messages, agent responses, reasoning, prior decisions. Grows linearly with every turn.

**6\. Memory**

Short-term memory from the current session. Long-term memory from previous sessions — user preferences, prior outcomes, learned patterns.

**7\. Agent State**

Current plan, todo list, progress markers, scratchpad notes. The meta-information tracking where the agent is in a multi-step task.

All 7 competing for the same window.

Context engineering is deciding what wins.

## The 4 Core Strategies

LangChain published the framework that organizes every context engineering technique into 4 buckets.

Every technique you will ever learn fits into one of these.

**Write. Select. Compress. Isolate.**

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_2DlwaIAAThKM?format=jpg&name=large)

## Strategy 1 — Write (Agents forget. Give them a way to remember.)

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_2TJ4aAAAArFR?format=jpg&name=large)

When an agent's context fills up and gets compacted, it loses information.

If the agent didn't write anything down before that happened — that information is gone forever.

**Write** means giving the agent ways to persist information outside the context window.

Three forms:

**Scratchpads**

Give the agent a tool that lets it take notes during a task. Intermediate findings. Decisions made. Information it knows it will need later.

Anthropic built a "think" tool — a dedicated space for Claude to work through problems.

On the tau-bench benchmark, this improved performance by up to 54% on certain tasks.

**Rules Files**

Persistent procedural memory.

If you've used Claude Code, you've seen CLAUDE.md.

Instructions loaded at the start of every session — project architecture, conventions, how to run tests, what to be careful about.

The agent reads it every time it starts.

It never forgets the fundamentals.

**Memory Extraction**

The agent saves facts, user preferences, and learned patterns so it can retrieve them across sessions.

Lives outside the context window entirely.

Information the agent needs tomorrow is there waiting when tomorrow comes.

## Strategy 2 — Select (Don't give the agent everything. Give it what it needs right now.)

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_2ljeaIAEcU85?format=jpg&name=large)

An agent with 40 tools, a large knowledge base, and several sessions of history cannot load all of that at once.

Something has to decide what's relevant for this step.

**Traditional RAG:** the system decides.

User asks → retrieve documents → stuff into prompt → done.

Static. One-shot. The model has no say.

**Agentic RAG:** the agent decides. It searches for what it needs, refines queries, picks tools, determines when it has enough information.

Retrieval as an iterative process, not a one-shot pipeline.

This matters because what's relevant changes at every step — and only the agent knows what it needs next.

**The tool selection problem is the one that trips people up most.**

If your agent has 40+ tools, that's potentially 10,000 tokens of tool definitions sitting in context before any work begins.

The fix: **RAG over tool descriptions.**

Instead of dumping all tool definitions in every call, use semantic search to surface only the tools relevant to the current step.

A paper called RAG-MCP tested this.

Tool-selection accuracy: 14% → 43% (3x improvement). Token usage: cut roughly in half.

Anthropic calls it a **hybrid strategy**: load essential context up front (like CLAUDE.md), let the agent do just-in-time retrieval for everything else.

Front-load the basics. Retrieve the rest on demand.

## Strategy 3 — Compress (Context accumulates. Keep the meaning, cut the tokens.)

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_2so1acAAgSmD?format=jpg&name=large)

Even with good selection, context accumulates.

Every tool call, retrieved document, and decision stays in the window.

Imagine your agent has made 20 tool calls.

Context: 80,000 tokens of accumulated tool outputs, conversation history, reasoning traces.

Most of that is no longer relevant. The agent already acted on it.

But it's still there, taking space, degrading attention, driving up cost and latency.

**You can compress at 3 points.**

**Before information enters context:**

→ Chunk large documents into coherent pieces before retrieval

→ Rerank so only the most useful chunks make it in

→ Summarize tool outputs on the fly before they enter the main context

**While the agent is working:**

→ Rolling summary of conversation history — continuously updated

→ Popular hybrid: keep last 10 messages verbatim + summarize everything older

→ Hard trimming: remove older messages once context hits a size threshold

→ Claude Code auto-compaction: triggers at 95% capacity, automatically summarizes full trajectory

**After the agent has acted on something:**

→ Tool result clearing: once a tool result was used 15 steps ago, drop it

→ Replace with a one-line summary or remove entirely

→ The agent does not need the full text of a web page it fetched 20 steps ago

The goal: reduce token count. Preserve what actually matters.

## Strategy 4 — Isolate (The most powerful strategy. Enables multi-agent systems.)

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_3H6uaAAAcMy6?format=jpg&name=large)

Here is the deeper problem with long agent runs.

It's not just space. It's contamination.

The detailed file searches from the research phase are still sitting in context when the agent moves to writing code.

That old research context is now noise. It's distracting the model during a phase where it needs to focus on clean implementation.

**Isolation means giving different parts of the work their own separate context windows.**

**Sub-agents**

A parent agent delegates a focused subtask — "search the codebase for all authentication-related files" — to a sub-agent.

The sub-agent works in its own clean context window.

When it reports back, it returns only a condensed summary.

All the messy search operations stay isolated in the sub-agent's context and never pollute the parent.

**State schema isolation** (LangGraph's approach)

Design the agent's state so different fields store different types of context.

The LLM only sees the fields relevant to the current step.

Tool results sit in a "backstage" field — invisible to the model until explicitly surfaced.

Fine-grained control over what the agent sees at each step without spinning up separate sub-agents.

Isolation is what makes complex multi-step workflows actually reliable.

Different jobs. Different context windows. No contamination.

## 4 Ways Agents Fail (Name the failure. Fix it.)

Drew Breunig identified four distinct failure modes as agent context grows.

Every broken agent you've ever seen falls into one of these.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_3K1zasAAHvjO?format=jpg&name=large)

**Failure 1: Context Poisoning**

A hallucination or error enters context.

The agent references it again and again in subsequent steps.

Bad data from step 5 compounds into every step after.

**Fix:** Validate tool outputs before they enter context. After recovering from an error, compress the failed-attempt history. Don't leave 10 steps of dead-end debugging visible when only the resolution matters.

━━━

**Failure 2: Context Distraction**

Context gets so long the model starts over-relying on recent history.

Instead of synthesizing a novel plan, it just rehashes what it recently did.

It stops thinking. It starts repeating.

**Fix:** Summarize and prune aggressively. Even when you have a large context window available. Big window does not mean fill it.

━━━

**Failure 3: Context Confusion**

Superfluous content leads the model to low-quality decisions.

Classic example: a model failing on a benchmark when given 46 tools — even though the context was well within limits — but working fine with only 19 tools.

The tools were not too many for the context to hold.

They were too many for the model to reason about clearly.

**Fix:** Dynamic tool management. Use RAG-MCP to surface only the tools relevant to the current step. Keep the tool set matched to the current phase.

━━━

**Failure 4: Context Clash**

New information contradicts something already in context.

The system prompt says one thing. A retrieved document says something different.

The agent cannot reconcile the contradiction. Produces inconsistent behavior.

**Fix:** Establish a clear authority ordering. System prompt > retrieved facts > conversation history. Validate new information against existing context before injecting. Use XML tags and clear headers so the model knows which source to trust.

## How to Write System Prompts for Agents (Not chatbots. Agents.)

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_3djBacAAVxWq?format=jpg&name=large)

A chatbot system prompt sets a tone.

"You are a helpful assistant. Be concise and friendly."

An agent system prompt defines architecture.

It specifies control flow — how to approach task types, which tools to use when, what to do on errors, what guardrails to follow.

It is closer to writing a job description for an autonomous employee than a personality prompt.

Anthropic calls it writing at the "right altitude."

**Too prescriptive:**"If the user mentions billing AND mentions a refund AND the amount is over $100, call tool X." Fragile. Breaks on every edge case you didn't anticipate.

**Too vague:**"Be helpful and use the appropriate tools." Gives the agent nothing. It can't make good autonomous decisions without concrete signals.

**The sweet spot:**Specific enough to guide autonomous behavior. Flexible enough for the model to apply judgment in novel situations. Strong heuristics. Not rigid rules.

**Practical tips:**

→ Organize with XML tags or markdown headers — Background, Instructions, Tool Guidance

→ Start minimal and iterate on failures — don't try to anticipate every edge case up front

→ Minimal doesn't mean short — a complex agent system prompt can be thousands of tokens and that's fine as long as every token earns its place

→ Use few-shot examples — show the agent what good behavior looks like rather than trying to describe every rule in words

## The KV-Cache: The $$$ reason to care about context order

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_34ubbAAAdW1c?format=jpg&name=large)

Most agent builders don't know this exists.

When you send tokens to an LLM, the model computes key-value representations for each token.

Computationally expensive.

So inference providers cache these representations.

If the beginning of your context — the prefix — stays the same between API calls, the provider reuses the cached computation and only processes the new tokens at the end.

Fast. Cheap.

But if you rearrange or change the early part of your context between calls — you invalidate the cache. The provider recomputes everything from scratch.

The cost difference on Claude Sonnet:

→ Cached input tokens: **$0.30 per million**

→ Uncached input tokens: **$3.00 per million**

**10x difference.**

For an agent making 30–40 API calls per task, this adds up fast.

**Practical rules for KV-cache efficiency:**

→ Stable content goes at the TOP of context — system prompt, tool definitions, anything that doesn't change between turns

→ Dynamic content goes at the BOTTOM — conversation history, current step, agent state → Don't dynamically add and remove tools mid-conversation — it invalidates the cache

→ Use **tool masking** instead of tool removal — keep all tool definitions stable in the prefix (cached), just mark irrelevant ones as unavailable for the current phase

## The Workflow That Ships 35,000 Lines of Code in 7 Hours

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK_3-45aQAA8EJ7?format=jpg&name=large)

Dex Horthy (CEO of HumanLayer) presented this at the AI Engineer Code Summit.

His team reportedly used it to ship ~35,000 lines of code to a large Rust codebase in one 7-hour session.

The method: **Frequent Intentional Compaction.**

Structure agent work into phases. Each phase produces a compacted artifact. Each new phase starts with a fresh context window containing only that artifact.

Stay deliberately below 40–60% of the context window at all times.

**Phase 1 — Research**

Sub-agents explore the codebase. Read files. Trace data flows. Map architecture.

All the messy grep results and file contents stay in sub-agent contexts. Never touch the parent. (Isolate)

Output: a compact research.md — file paths, function signatures, patterns, gotchas. (Write)

Context reset: raw research used 60–80% of the window. The research artifact compresses it down to 15–20%. (Compress)

**Phase 2 — Planning**

New context window. Contains only: research document + problem definition.

Agent produces a detailed implementation plan.

**This is the most important human review checkpoint.**

Catch logic errors here where fixing them is easy and free. Later it costs hours.

**Phase 3 — Implementation**

Another fresh context window. Contains only: the plan.

Agent follows it step by step.

For complex tasks: a progress.md tracks what's been completed and what remains. (Write)

The result: a clean, focused agent at every phase. No contamination. No context rot. No "sloppy step 20."

## How the best platforms handle this differently

**Claude Code**

Hybrid retrieval. CLAUDE.md loads up front. Tools like glob and grep handle just-in-time codebase navigation.

Auto-compaction at 95% — preserves architectural decisions and the 5 most recently accessed files.

Can spawn sub-agents for complex subtasks, each with their own clean context.

Philosophy: "do the simplest thing that works." Let the model be smart about what it needs and give it tools to go find it.

**Manus**

KV-cache-aware context ordering: stable prefix, dynamic suffix. Tool masking not removal.

Observation compression pipeline — every tool output is processed before entering the agent's context.

Persistent todo list for state tracking.

File system as overflow memory for evicted context.

Built for scale. Serving hundreds of thousands of users where efficiency is a cost-of-business problem.

**ChatGPT Agent**

Visual-first approach. The agent interacts with a GUI browser.

Screenshots added to context as visual snapshots. Model reasons over what it sees.

Visual tokens are expensive so the agent is selective about screenshot count.

Uses RL to learn optimal tool-use strategies across thousands of virtual machines rather than explicitly programming them.

**Google ADK**

The most principled architectural approach.

Three design principles:

1. Separate storage from presentation — durable state is not the same as what appears in each API call
2. Explicit transformations — named, ordered processors that transform context in testable, composable steps
3. Scope context by default — every model call sees only the minimum required information

Engineering discipline over prompt crafting.

## The universal agent turn pipeline

Every serious platform converges on the same 5-step loop per agent turn:

→ **Collect** — user input, conversation history, tool results, retrieved docs, agent state

→ **Select** — what's relevant for this step within the remaining token budget

→ **Compress** — summarize, truncate, or restructure to fit the context → **Arrange** — stable content first (cache), dynamic content last

→ **Assemble + call** — final context → API call → get output → loop

This is the loop running inside every production agent you've ever used.

Understanding it is what separates builders who ship reliable agents from builders who wonder why their agent goes sloppy at step 15.

**The summary**

Context rot is real and starts well before your context limit.

The 4 strategies that fix it:

→ **Write** — persist info outside context so agents don't forget

→ **Select** — pull in only what's needed for this step

→ **Compress** — cut tokens, keep meaning, proactively not reactively

→ **Isolate** — separate contexts for separate jobs, no contamination

The 4 failure modes to watch for:

→ **Poisoning** — bad data compounds through every step

→ **Distraction** — long history makes agents rehash instead of think

→ **Confusion** — too many tools degrades decision quality

→ **Clash** — contradictions produce inconsistent behavior

The KV-cache is worth 10x cost savings. Put stable content first.

The best workflow: research → compact → plan → compact → implement. Fresh context at every phase.

Context engineering is not optional for serious agent work.

It is the work.
